 We see that Floating village resedential has higher salesprice followed by Resedential 
 low density.

 Commercial has the lowest salesprice.

 LotFrontage
 ------------

 Numerical variable

 From scatterplot we can see that there are no defenite correlation between LotFrontage and
 SalePrice

 Almost 259 entries are missing in the Data.

 From scatterplot we can observe that there are no defenite correlation between LotArea and 
 SalePrice.

 Street
 -------

 Categorical variable

 We can see from the count plot and subsequent percentage calculation that the paved road access
 dominate the data set with almost 99% of the road access being paved.

 We can see from the boxplot that paved road access tends to have higher sale price also probably beacuase 
 of higher demand. ---------- We don't need to do this as it is already categorical and converts to 1 and 0 
 when we label encode that variables.

 We can actually classify this as demand being higher for paved and lower for gravel.

------

Categorical variable

We can see that the number of gravel alley is more with around 50, than paved which only has 41.
Majority of the houses does not have any alley access.

We observe from the boxplot that, Moderately irregular houses has the highest median Sale Price, 
followed by highly irregular, slightly irregular and regular.

LandContour
-------------

LandContours.

We can also observe from the boxplot and the barplot that Hillside has the highest median followed by depression, 
level and banked.

Utilities
-----------

Categorical variable

We observe that all except 1 property is All public utilities.

We also observe on plotting a box plot that the median of All public is higher than that of the 
NoSeWa.

properties with these type of utilities might have lower SalePrice.

Also from boxplot we can clearly see that cul-de-sac LotConfig has higher SalePrice.

than gentle slope.

 We can see from count_value that North Ames has the highest number of buyers followed by
 College Creek, Old Town and Edwards where have above 100 buyers in the data set.
