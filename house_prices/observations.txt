MSSubClass
-----------

Categorical variable

 It is observed that MSSubClass of 60, that is 2-story 1946 & newer has a higher
 sales price.

 MSSubClass 30, that is 1-story 1945 & older has the least sales prices.

 Number of people who bought MSSubClass 20, that is 1-story 1946 @ newer all styles
 are the highest.

 MSZoning
 ------------

 categorical variable

 We see that Floating village resedential has higher salesprice followed by Resedential 
 low density.

 Commercial has the lowest salesprice.

 We also observe that most people bought Residential Low Density.

 LotFrontage
 ------------

 Numerical variable

 From scatterplot we can see that there are no defenite correlation between LotFrontage and
 SalePrice

 Almost 259 entries are missing in the Data.

 LotArea
 --------

 Numerical Variable

 From scatterplot we can observe that there are no defenite correlation between LotArea and 
 SalePrice.

 Street
 -------

 Categorical variable

 We can see from the count plot and subsequent percentage calculation that the paved road access
 dominate the data set with almost 99% of the road access being paved.

 We can see from the boxplot that paved road access tends to have higher sale price also probably beacuase 
 of higher demand. ---------- We don't need to do this as it is already categorical and converts to 1 and 0 
 when we label encode that variables.

 We can actually classify this as demand being higher for paved and lower for gravel.

Alley
------

Categorical variable

We can see that the number of gravel alley is more with around 50, than paved which only has 41.
Majority of the houses does not have any alley access.

We grouped the null values to 'NO' as in No access to alley.

We see that paved alley acces has higher median SalePrice than both gravel and no access to alley.

LotShape
---------

Categorical variable

We see that the number of regular shaped houses are more followed by slightly irregular.

We observe from the boxplot that, Moderately irregular houses has the highest median Sale Price, 
followed by highly irregular, slightly irregular and regular.

LandContour
-------------

Categorical variable

We can observe from count plot that near flat/level houses are bought more than every other 
LandContours.

We can also observe from the boxplot and the barplot that Hillside has the highest median followed by depression, 
level and banked.

Utilities
-----------

Categorical variable

We observe that all except 1 property is All public utilities.

We also observe on plotting a box plot that the median of All public is higher than that of the 
NoSeWa.

We can see from the training set that there are no demand for NoSeWr and ELO, hence we can say that
properties with these type of utilities might have lower SalePrice.

LotConfig
----------

Categorical variable

We can observe that inside lot has more buyers.

Also from boxplot we can clearly see that cul-de-sac LotConfig has higher SalePrice.

LandSlope
-----------

Categorical variable

we can see that the gentle slope on the property has more buyers but severe slope and moderate slope has a higher median SalePrice
than gentle slope.

 Neighborhood 
 ---------------

 Categorical variable

 We can see from count_value that North Ames has the highest number of buyers followed by
 College Creek, Old Town and Edwards where have above 100 buyers in the data set.

 We can see that Bluestem has the lowest buyer.

 We can see the SalePrice at Northridge Heights are higher compared to others followed by Northridge and Stone Brook.

 Condition1
 -------------

 Categorical variable

 We can observe that most people bought normal without any conditions

 but when there is a condition, more people wanted a house Adjacent to feeder street.

 From barplot and boxplot we can observe that houses Near positive off-site feature--park, greenbelt, etc. and
 houses Within 200' of North-South Railroad has the highest median salesprice while houses Adjacent to arterial street
 has the lowest median salesprice.

 Condition2
 ---------------

 categorical variable

 Just like before, most people bought normal without any conditions.

 Since Condition2 is active only if there is more than one condition, we need to combine condition1 and 2 together.
After combining, we need to group into categories inorder to further clean the data.

BldgType
--------------

Categorical variable

We see that majority of the people bought single family detached house. We cannot really compare other
BldgType to 1Fam beacause of the sheer number of it.

We cannot establish a relation with SalePrice without treating the outliers and overcome the size difference.

HouseStyle
-----------------

We see that 1 story houses are bought more followed by 2 story.

We can see a trend that unfinished houses tend to have lower SalePrice.

We can also see split foyer style also tend to have lower SalePrice.

We can also see that Two and one-half story: 2nd level finished relatively higher SalePrice.

Outliers are observed and needs to be corrected.

OverallQual
-------------------

Categorical variable

There is undeniable that as the overall quality of the house increases, then the SalePrice also
increases.

OverallCond
-------------------

Categorical variable

There are outliers and needs to be treated. But we can see that as the overall condition increases then
the SalePrice also increases.

YearBuilt
------------------

Numerical values

We can see from the scatterplot that usually as the year of the house build increases the SalePrice also
increase.

We can group the years and make it categorical to refine the data set a bit more.

YearRemodAdd
-------------------

Numerical values

If the house is not remodeled, then the year is the YearBuilt, therefore,
we need to combine both the columns and find a relationship and engineer a common feature inorder to 
refine the data set.

RoofStyle
--------------------

Categorical values

We can see that majority if the houses has the roofstyle gable.

We can see that apart from gable, the SalePrice tends to higher for Hip and shed.

RoofMatl
-------------------

Categorical values

A staggering majority of houses use Standard (Composite) Shingle as the roof material.

Wood Shingles has the highest SalePrice according to boxplot. 

There are outliers and we need to establish a relationship between roofstyle and roof material 
to correctly predict the SalePrice.

Exterior1st
-----------------

Categorical values

Most of the houses use Vinyl Siding.

It is observed that Imitation Stucco, Stone and Cement Board is comparatively higher in SalePrice.

It is also observed that Brick Common has the least SalePrice.

Exterior2nd
-----------------

Categorical values

note that if only there are more than 1 Exterior covering, this column becomes active.

We need to combine this column with Exterior1st coulumn and then group inorder to predict SalePrice
with good accuracy.

MasVnrType
-----------------

Categorical values

We see that there are 8 missing values in this column. We need to find a way to fill these values.

We observe that Stone Masonry Veneer has the highest SalePrice followed by Brick Face.

We can also observe that brick common has the lowest SalePrice.

MasVnrArea
-------------------

Numerical values

8 null values.

There is almost no correlation between MasVnrArea with SalePrice.

Cannot clearly establish a relationship with neither SalePrice or MasVnrType.

ExterQual
-----------------

Categorical values

As expected the value of SalePrice increases as the ExterQual increases.

ExterCond
---------------

categorical values

As expected if external condition increases the SalePrice increases.

Outliers are observed and needs to treated.

Foundation
----------------

Categorical values

highest SalePrice is for Poured Contrete followed by wood and stone.

lowest is for slab.
