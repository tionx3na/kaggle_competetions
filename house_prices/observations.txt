MSSubClass
-----------

Categorical variable

 It is observed that MSSubClass of 60, that is 2-story 1946 & newer has a higher
 sales price.

 MSSubClass 30, that is 1-story 1945 & older has the least sales prices.

 Number of people who bought MSSubClass 20, that is 1-story 1946 @ newer all styles
 are the highest.

 MSZoning
 ------------

 categorical variable

 We see that Floating village resedential has higher salesprice followed by Resedential 
 low density.

 Commercial has the lowest salesprice.

 We also observe that most people bought Residential Low Density.

 LotFrontage
 ------------

 Numerical variable

 From scatterplot we can see that there are no defenite correlation between LotFrontage and
 SalePrice

 Almost 259 entries are missing in the Data.

 LotArea
 --------

 Numerical Variable

 From scatterplot we can observe that there are no defenite correlation between LotArea and 
 SalePrice.

 Street
 -------

 Categorical variable

 We can see from the count plot and subsequent percentage calculation that the paved road access
 dominate the data set with almost 99% of the road access being paved.

 We can see from the boxplot that paved road access tends to have higher sale price also probably beacuase 
 of higher demand. ---------- We don't need to do this as it is already categorical and converts to 1 and 0 
 when we label encode that variables.

 We can actually classify this as demand being higher for paved and lower for gravel.

Alley
------

Categorical variable

We can see that the number of gravel alley is more with around 50, than paved which only has 41.
Majority of the houses does not have any alley access.

We grouped the null values to 'NO' as in No access to alley.

We see that paved alley acces has higher median SalePrice than both gravel and no access to alley.

LotShape
---------

Categorical variable

We see that the number of regular shaped houses are more followed by slightly irregular.

We observe from the boxplot that, Moderately irregular houses has the highest median Sale Price, 
followed by highly irregular, slightly irregular and regular.

LandContour
-------------

Categorical variable

We can observe from count plot that near flat/level houses are bought more than every other 
LandContours.

We can also observe from the boxplot and the barplot that Hillside has the highest median followed by depression, 
level and banked.

Utilities
-----------

Categorical variable

We observe that all except 1 property is All public utilities.

We also observe on plotting a box plot that the median of All public is higher than that of the 
NoSeWa.

We can see from the training set that there are no demand for NoSeWr and ELO, hence we can say that
properties with these type of utilities might have lower SalePrice.

LotConfig
----------

Categorical variable

We can observe that inside lot has more buyers.

Also from boxplot we can clearly see that cul-de-sac LotConfig has higher SalePrice.

LandSlope
-----------

Categorical variable

we can see that the gentle slope on the property has more buyers but severe slope and moderate slope has a higher median SalePrice
than gentle slope.

 Neighborhood 
 ---------------

 Categorical variable

 We can see from count_value that North Ames has the highest number of buyers followed by
 College Creek, Old Town and Edwards where have above 100 buyers in the data set.

 We can see that Bluestem has the lowest buyer.

 We can see the SalePrice at Northridge Heights are higher compared to others followed by Northridge and Stone Brook.

 Condition1
 -------------

 Categorical variable

 We can observe that most people bought normal without any conditions

 but when there is a condition, more people wanted a house Adjacent to feeder street.

 From barplot and boxplot we can observe that houses Near positive off-site feature--park, greenbelt, etc. and
 houses Within 200' of North-South Railroad has the highest median salesprice while houses Adjacent to arterial street
 has the lowest median salesprice.

 Condition2
 ---------------

 categorical variable

 Just like before, most people bought normal without any conditions.

 Since Condition2 is active only if there is more than one condition, we need to combine condition1 and 2 together.
After combining, we need to group into categories inorder to further clean the data.

BldgType
--------------

Categorical variable

We see that majority of the people bought single family detached house. We cannot really compare other
BldgType to 1Fam beacause of the sheer number of it.

We cannot establish a relation with SalePrice without treating the outliers and overcome the size difference.

HouseStyle
-----------------

We see that 1 story houses are bought more followed by 2 story.

We can see a trend that unfinished houses tend to have lower SalePrice.

We can also see split foyer style also tend to have lower SalePrice.

We can also see that Two and one-half story: 2nd level finished relatively higher SalePrice.

Outliers are observed and needs to be corrected.

OverallQual
-------------------

Categorical variable

There is undeniable that as the overall quality of the house increases, then the SalePrice also
increases.

OverallCond
-------------------

Categorical variable

There are outliers and needs to be treated. But we can see that as the overall condition increases then
the SalePrice also increases.

YearBuilt
------------------

Numerical values

We can see from the scatterplot that usually as the year of the house build increases the SalePrice also
increase.

We can group the years and make it categorical to refine the data set a bit more.

YearRemodAdd
-------------------

Numerical values

If the house is not remodeled, then the year is the YearBuilt, therefore,
we need to combine both the columns and find a relationship and engineer a common feature inorder to 
refine the data set.

RoofStyle
--------------------

Categorical values

We can see that majority if the houses has the roofstyle gable.

We can see that apart from gable, the SalePrice tends to higher for Hip and shed.

RoofMatl
-------------------

Categorical values

A staggering majority of houses use Standard (Composite) Shingle as the roof material.

Wood Shingles has the highest SalePrice according to boxplot. 

There are outliers and we need to establish a relationship between roofstyle and roof material 
to correctly predict the SalePrice.

Exterior1st
-----------------

Categorical values

Most of the houses use Vinyl Siding.

It is observed that Imitation Stucco, Stone and Cement Board is comparatively higher in SalePrice.

It is also observed that Brick Common has the least SalePrice.

Exterior2nd
-----------------

Categorical values

note that if only there are more than 1 Exterior covering, this column becomes active.

We need to combine this column with Exterior1st coulumn and then group inorder to predict SalePrice
with good accuracy.

MasVnrType
-----------------

Categorical values

We see that there are 8 missing values in this column. We need to find a way to fill these values.

We observe that Stone Masonry Veneer has the highest SalePrice followed by Brick Face.

We can also observe that brick common has the lowest SalePrice.

MasVnrArea
-------------------

Numerical values

8 null values.

There is almost no correlation between MasVnrArea with SalePrice.

Cannot clearly establish a relationship with neither SalePrice or MasVnrType.

ExterQual
-----------------

Categorical values

As expected the value of SalePrice increases as the ExterQual increases.

ExterCond
---------------

categorical values

As expected if external condition increases the SalePrice increases.

Outliers are observed and needs to treated.

Foundation
----------------

Categorical values

highest SalePrice is for Poured Contrete followed by wood and stone.

lowest is for slab.

BsmtQual
-----------------

categorical values

37 null values observed.

As ecpected, if the basement Height increases, the SalePrice also increases.

Outliers are detected and needs to be corrected and the null values needs to filled.

We see that the dataset doesnot have the poor and no basement values.

BsmtCond
----------------

categorical value

again, 37 null values

Here we observe that there are no excellent and no basement values.

But typically from data set we can see that as basement condition grade increases, the SalePrice
also increases.

We need to find a way to combine the BsmtQual and BsmtCond for better prediction.

BsmtExposure
-----------------

categorical value

38 missing values here.

Again, as Basement exposure grade increases, the SalePrice increases.

outliers needs to be corrected.

BsmtFinType1
-----------------

37 null values

categorical value

We see that Good Living Quarters has the highest SalePrice.

We can also observe that Below Average Living Quarters and Average Rec Room has the lowest SalePrice.

we need to correct the outliers and fill the null values.

BsmtFinSF1
-----------------

Numerical value

This column are the square feets of finished area only.

We can fill the null values of the previous variables, if this variable is 0 and
the previous variables are not unfinished.

We can see from the scatterplot and the pearson correlation that there is no significant
relation between BsmtFinSF1 and SalePrice.

BsmtFinType2
----------------

categorical value

Active if there are multiple types of basements.

38 null values.

The number of unfinished basements are very high.

outliers needs to be treated.

Average Living Quarters and Good Living Quarters have the highest SalePrice.


BsmtFinSF2
----------------

Numerical values

We can see that there are not much of correlation between BsmtFinSF2 and SalePrice.

we can use this variable to fill the null values in BsmtFinType2.

BsmtUnfSF
----------------

Numerical values

Unfinished square feet of basement.

We can see that there is a clear relationship between BsmtUnfSF and TotalBsmtSF. We can use this
relationship to engineer features.

TotalBsmtSF
----------------

Numerical values

We can see that there definite correlation between total basement area. We could see if we can improve 
the correlation with the help of the above features.

Heating
---------------

Categorical values

We can see that Gas forced warm air furnace is more in numbers. therefore there are outliers and needs to be treated.

We see that Gas hot water or steam heat has higher SalePrice.

HeatingQC
----------------

Categorical values

Undeniable relationship between SalePrice.

CentralAir
------------------

Categorical values

Clearly, if there is central air condition, then the SalePrice is higher.
Alos most people choose to have a central air condition.

Electrical
-----------------

Categorical values

There is 1 null value.

Most people chose Standard Circuit Breakers & Romex.

Outlier treatment is needed.

Standard Circuit Breakers & Romex has highest SalePrice followed by Fuse Box over 60 AMP and all Romex wiring (Average).

1stFlrSF
--------------------

Numerical values

we can see that there is correlation between the square feet of the first floor and the SalePrice.

2ndFlrSF
----------------

Numerical values

0 means there is no second floor.
We need to clean the data as we need to remove or fill 0 with other values. Since it brings down the prediction accuracy.

If we remove 0, we see that there is a defenite correlation between 2ndFlrSF and SalePrice.

LowQualFinSF
---------------

Numerical values

There is no relationship with SalePrice at all.

We can actually drop this feature altogether.

GrLivArea 
---------------

Numerical value

There is clear and significant relationship between Ground living area and SalePrice.

BsmtFullBath
---------------

Categorical value

Outliers needs to be treated.

But we can see a trend that as the number of full bathrooms in the basement increases, the SalePrice also
increases.

BsmtHalfBath
---------------

Categorical value

outliers needs to be treated.  But there is a genral  trend that houses with 0 half bathrooms are more.

We can observe that there is a very slight relationship with SalePrice which i believe can be imporoved 
by correcting the outliers.

FullBath
-------------

Categorical value

There is a general trend as the number of bathroom increases, the SalePrice increases but houses with
0 bathroom tends to defy this as it generally costs more than the houses with 1 bathroom.

outliers needs to corrected.

HalfBath
-------------

Categorical value

Outliers needs to be treated but there is a general trend of number of bathrooms determines
how much the SalePrice is.

BedroomAbvGr
---------------

Categorical value

We see that the general trend of "As number of bedroom increases, SalePrice increases" applies only
to houses with 2,3 and 4 bedrooms. 

Exception is for houses with 0 or 1 bedrooms, since it seems to define the general trend.

I believe if the outliers are treated the rest of the categories behave within the trend except for
0 and 1.

KitchenAbvGr
----------------

Categorical value

There is defintely data cleaning required here. 
We see that most houses have 1 kitchen.
I cannot really find a correlation of number of kitchen with SalePrice before data cleaning anyway.

KitchenQual
----------------

Categorical value

There is defenite correlation between Kitchen quality and SalePrice.
We can combine this with KitchenAbvGr to refine it it more.

TotRmsAbvGrd
---------------

Categorical value

outliers needs to cleaned.

We can see that there is a general trend that if the number of total rooms above ground increases,
then SalePrice also increases, except for houses for 12 rooms, and we need to find a good cleaning
method to correct this.

Functional
---------------

Categorical value

We see that majority has typical functionalities.

We can also observe that, If the functionalities has major deductions 2, then the SalePrice is very low.

outliers needs to treated or not.

Fireplaces
----------------

Categorical value

We see that there is significant correlation with SalePrice. 

FireplaceQu
----------------

Categorical value

There are only 770 non-null values. 
We need to fill the null values with "No fireplace".

We can see that there is a correlation that as the quality increases, the SalePrice also increases.

GarageType
---------------

Categorical value

There are null values. Null values to be filled with "No garage"

outliers are ther and needs to be corrected. Built-in garage tends to be higher in SalePrice.

GarageYrBlt
-------------

Numerical value

there are null values and needs to be filled.

But we can see that there is a general trend of, "Later the years, higher the SalePrice"

GarageFinish
---------------

Categorical values

There are null values and needs to be filled and outliers needs to be corrected. Null values
needs to be filled with "no garage".

Finished garage tends to have higher price, while unfinished garage tends to have lower price.

GarageCars
---------------

Categorical values

Outliers needs to be corrected.

Generally higher the number of cars that the garage can fit in, higher SalePrice.

GarageArea
----------------

Numerical value

Null values present.

We can see that garageArea has a slight correlation with SalePrice.

We need to clean the data of 0, that is no garage.

GarageQual
--------------

Categorical value

Null values present.

Outliers needs to be corrected. Apart from that, we can see there is clear correlation with SalePrice.

GarageCond
--------------

Categorical value

Outliers are observed and doesn't have significant correlation to SalePrice, even though i believe it can be 
established once the data is cleaned and the outlier is treated.


PavedDrive
---------------

Categorical

Outliers needs to be treated.

Paved and partially paved tends to have higher SalePrice than gravel/dirt.

WoodDeckSF
-----------------

Numerical

If we avoid 0 wood deck square feet( no wood deck), there is a slight correlation with SalePrice.

OpenPorchSF
----------------

Numerical

If outliers are treated, then there is a slight correlation between Open poarch and SalePrice.

EnclosedPorch
----------------

Numerical

There is almost no correlation with SalePrice.

There is almost no correlation with OpenPorchSF either.

3SsnPorch
----------------

Numerical

There is no correlation with SalePrice.

We can maybe see if we could engineer new feature from it.

ScreenPorch
----------------

Numerical

Again no direct correlation with SalePrice. but can be used to engineer new feature.
Especially turn all the poarch types into categorical column.

PoolArea
--------------

Numerical

There are only 7 values which are not 0.
logically if pool area increases, the salesprice should increase.


PoolQC
--------------

Categorical

There are only 7 non null fields.

We can actually drop this fiels.

logically if pool quality increases, the salesprice should increase.


Fence
-------------

Categorical

Only 281 non null values.

We need to fill the null values with "no fence"

If ouliers are corrected, there is a correlation forming with SalePrice.

MiscFeature
--------------

Categorical

only 54 non null values.

There is outlier with shed an needs to be corrected.

There is a trend we can see with SalePrice.
If there is a tennis court the salesprice tends to be higher followed by a 2nd garage.

MiscVal
-------------

Numerical

Cannot establish a relationship with SalePrice. Although it maybe possible to mix with MiscFeature
to get a usable feature.

MoSold
------------

Categorical

Outliers are present and needs to be corrected.

We see that the SalePrice is higher in the month september and november then lowest in april and may.

YrSold
----------
Categorical

There is almost no correlation with SalePrice.
